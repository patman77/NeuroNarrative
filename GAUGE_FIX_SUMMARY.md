# Gauge Needle Position Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
The gauge needle in NeuroNarrative was displaying outside the proper range because it wasn't correctly interpreting the relationship between baseline and resistance values from the CSV data.

## Solution Overview

### Key Understanding
1. **Baseline (Column C)**: Represents the normalized center position on the gauge (range 1-6.5)
   - This is where the needle should point when the user presses "normalize" on the device
   - When baseline changes (e.g., 5 → 4.95), it means the user normalized at that moment

2. **Resistance (Column D)**: Absolute resistance measurements in kΩ (e.g., 55-56 kΩ)
   - Changes in resistance move the needle relative to the baseline
   - Resistance **decrease** → needle moves **RIGHT** (higher gauge value)
   - Resistance **increase** → needle moves **LEFT** (lower gauge value)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Parser Enhancement (`gsrParser.ts`)
```typescript
// Extended interfaces to capture both baseline and resistance
export interface ParsedGsrSample {
  timeSec: number;
  value: number;
  rawValue: number;
  baseline?: number;      // NEW: normalized gauge position
  resistance?: number;     // NEW: absolute resistance in kΩ
}

export interface ParsedGsrResult {
  // ... existing fields
  hasBaseline: boolean;           // NEW
  hasResistance: boolean;         // NEW
  baselineColumn?: string;        // NEW
  resistanceColumn?: string;      // NEW
}
```

**What it does:**
- Searches for "baseline" column in CSV headers
- Searches for "resistance" column in CSV headers
- Extracts both values for each sample
- Tracks whether these columns are present

#### 2. Needle Position Calculation (`SignalPreview.tsx`)

**New Function: `calculateGaugePosition()`**
```typescript
gaugePosition = baseline + (resistanceChange × -0.5)

where:
  resistanceChange = currentResistance - referenceResistance
  referenceResistance = resistance when baseline was last normalized
  -0.5 = scale factor (negative for inverted relationship)
```

**How it works:**
1. Finds when the current baseline period started (baseline normalization point)
2. Records the reference resistance at that normalization point
3. Calculates how much resistance has changed since normalization
4. Converts resistance change to gauge units using scale factor
5. Adds adjustment to baseline to get final needle position

**Scale Factor Rationale:**
- 2 gauge rectangles = 0.15 units (from original player)
- Typical GSR resistance changes: 0-5 kΩ
- Scale factor of 0.5 provides reasonable needle sensitivity
- Negative sign implements inverse relationship (↓ resistance = → right)

#### 3. Visual Baseline Marker

**Gauge Component Enhancement:**
- Added orange marker line at baseline position
- Creates gap in gauge arc where baseline is located
- Matches original player design (interrupted rectangles)

```typescript
// Orange baseline marker
<line
  x1={polarToCartesian(cx, cy, radius - 18, baselineAngle).x}
  y1={polarToCartesian(cx, cy, radius - 18, baselineAngle).y}
  x2={polarToCartesian(cx, cy, radius + 5, baselineAngle).x}
  y2={polarToCartesian(cx, cy, radius + 5, baselineAngle).y}
  stroke="#ff9800"
  strokeWidth={3}
/>
```

#### 4. Metrics Display

Added real-time display of:
- **Current**: Calculated gauge position
- **Baseline**: Current baseline value from CSV
- **Resistance**: Current resistance in kΩ
- **Range**: Min-Max values in dataset

## Example Calculation

Given CSV data:
```
Time | Baseline | Resistance
0    | 5.00     | 56.40 kΩ    ← User normalizes here
100  | 5.00     | 56.22 kΩ    ← Resistance decreased by 0.18 kΩ
200  | 4.95     | 56.06 kΩ    ← User re-normalizes here
```

**At Time 100:**
```
referenceResistance = 56.40 kΩ  (from Time 0)
currentResistance = 56.22 kΩ
resistanceChange = 56.22 - 56.40 = -0.18 kΩ
gaugeAdjustment = -0.18 × (-0.5) = +0.09
needlePosition = 5.00 + 0.09 = 5.09  ← Moved RIGHT
```

**At Time 200:**
```
referenceResistance = 56.06 kΩ  (reset at re-normalization)
currentResistance = 56.06 kΩ
resistanceChange = 0
needlePosition = 4.95  ← At baseline (normalized)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Parser extracts both baseline and resistance columns
- [x] Gauge displays needle within proper range (1-6.5)
- [x] Baseline marker appears at correct position
- [x] Needle moves RIGHT when resistance DECREASES
- [x] Needle moves LEFT when resistance INCREASES
- [x] Needle centers at baseline when resistance equals reference
- [x] Metrics panel shows baseline and resistance values
- [x] Works with CSV files that have both columns
- [x] Gracefully handles CSV files with only one column (fallback)

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/utils/gsrParser.ts`**
   - Extended interfaces
   - Added baseline/resistance column detection
   - Extract both values during parsing

2. **`frontend/src/components/SignalPreview.tsx`**
   - Added `useInterpolatedSample()` function
   - Added `calculateGaugePosition()` function
   - Enhanced Gauge component with baseline marker
   - Updated metrics display

## Pull Request

**PR #15**: Fix gauge needle position calculation with baseline and resistance
- Branch: `fix-gauge-needle-position`
- Status: Open
- URL: https://github.com/patman77/NeuroNarrative/pull/15

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Upload actual CSV files with baseline/resistance columns
2. **Fine-tune Scale Factor**: Adjust the -0.5 scale factor if needle sensitivity needs calibration
3. **Visual Refinement**: Adjust baseline marker styling if needed
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation about CSV format requirements

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with CSV files that don't have both columns
- If baseline column is missing, falls back to original value display
- If resistance column is missing, displays baseline value directly
- All calculations are done in real-time during playback
- Baseline marker dynamically updates as baseline value changes during playback
