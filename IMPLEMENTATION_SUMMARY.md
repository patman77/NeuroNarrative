# NeuroNarrative - Gauge and Navigation Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes and enhancements made to the NeuroNarrative application to resolve the gauge needle visibility issue and add comprehensive navigation features.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Gauge Needle Visibility Issue

**Problem:** The gauge needle was not visible in the upper part of the gauge despite the angle calculations being correct. The needle appeared to be out of range.

**Root Cause:** The SVG arc was being drawn with the wrong sweep direction. The `describeArc` function was using `sweep-flag=0` (counterclockwise), which caused the arc to be drawn through the BOTTOM of the semicircle instead of the TOP.

**Solution:** Changed the sweep flag from `0` to `1` (clockwise) in the `describeArc` function. This ensures the arc is drawn through the top, creating a proper top semicircle gauge where the needle is visible.

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before: sweep-flag=0 (counterclockwise - draws through bottom)
return `M ${start.x} ${start.y} A ${r} ${r} 0 ${largeArcFlag} 0 ${end.x} ${end.y}`;

// After: sweep-flag=1 (clockwise - draws through top)
return `M ${start.x} ${start.y} A ${r} ${r} 0 ${largeArcFlag} 1 ${end.x} ${end.y}`;
```

**Technical Details:**
- Gauge range: 1 to 6.5
- Arc angles: startAngle=π (left), endAngle=2π (right)
- Center position: near bottom of SVG (cy = height * 0.9)
- With clockwise sweep, the arc goes: left → up → top → up → right (forming the top semicircle)
- Needle angle calculation was already correct: `pointerAngle = startAngle + (endAngle - startAngle) * ratio`

## New Features Implemented

### 2. Overview Signal Plot

**Feature:** Added a full overview plot showing the entire recording from start to end.

**Implementation:**
- Created new `OverviewChart` component
- Displays compressed view of all signal data
- Shows vertical red bar indicating current playback position
- Width: 920px (fixed), Height: 120px
- Includes X and Y axes with timestamps and signal levels

**Benefits:**
- Users can see the entire session at a glance
- Easy to identify patterns and events across the full recording
- Visual context for current position in the timeline

### 3. Clickable Navigation in Overview Plot

**Feature:** Users can click anywhere in the overview plot to jump to that time position.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<SVGSVGElement>) => {
  const svg = e.currentTarget;
  const rect = svg.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const relativeX = clamp(x - leftPadding, 0, usableWidth);
  const clickedTime = startTime + (relativeX / usableWidth) * duration;
  onSeek(clickedTime);
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Quick navigation to any point in the recording
- Intuitive interaction model
- Visual feedback with cursor change

### 4. Navigation Control Buttons

**Feature:** Added four navigation buttons for precise control:
- **⏮ Beginning** - Jump to start of recording
- **⏪ -10s** - Skip backward 10 seconds
- **+10s ⏩** - Skip forward 10 seconds  
- **⏭ End** - Jump to end of recording

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const jumpToBeginning = () => seekTo(data.startTimeSec);
const jumpToEnd = () => seekTo(data.endTimeSec);
const skipForward = () => seekTo(audio.currentTime + data.startTimeSec + 10);
const skipBackward = () => seekTo(audio.currentTime + data.startTimeSec - 10);
```

**Benefits:**
- Precise navigation control
- Keyboard-friendly interface potential
- Standard media player controls

### 5. Axes for Signal Plots

**Feature:** Added professional axes to both detail and overview plots.

**Detail Plot Axes:**
- **X-axis:** Time ticks every 10 seconds with MM:SS format
- **Y-axis:** 5 evenly-spaced signal level ticks
- Grid lines for easy reading

**Overview Plot Axes:**
- **X-axis:** Time ticks every 30 seconds with MM:SS format
- **Y-axis:** 3 evenly-spaced signal level ticks
- Lighter grid lines for overview context

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// X-axis ticks generation
const xTicks = useMemo(() => {
  const tickInterval = 10; // seconds for detail, 30 for overview
  const ticks: { x: number; label: string }[] = [];
  for (let t = 0; t <= duration; t += tickInterval) {
    const x = leftPadding + (t / duration) * width;
    ticks.push({ x, label: formatTime(t) });
  }
  return ticks;
}, [duration, width, leftPadding]);

// Y-axis ticks generation
const yTicks = useMemo(() => {
  const numTicks = 5; // 5 for detail, 3 for overview
  return Array.from({ length: numTicks }, (_, i) => {
    const ratio = i / (numTicks - 1);
    const value = min + (max - min) * ratio;
    const y = topPadding + (1 - ratio) * usableHeight;
    return { y, value: value.toFixed(1) };
  });
}, [min, max, topPadding, usableHeight]);
```

**Benefits:**
- Professional scientific visualization
- Easy to read exact values and timestamps
- Better understanding of signal dynamics

## Integration and Synchronization

### All Controls Work Together
- Audio playback position updates all visualizations
- Clicking overview plot updates audio position
- Navigation buttons update audio position
- All changes are logged for debugging
- State is properly managed through React hooks

### State Management
```javascript
const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(0);
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

// Synchronized through:
useEffect(() => {
  const audio = audioRef.current;
  // ... listeners for timeupdate, play, pause, ended
}, [audioUrl]);
```

## CSS Styling

Added professional styling for new components:

```css
/* Navigation controls */
.navigation-controls {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.75rem;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 1rem 0;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.2);
}

.nav-button {
  border: 1px solid rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.4);
  background: rgba(30, 41, 59, 0.9);
  color: inherit;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.6rem 1.2rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background 0.2s ease, border 0.2s ease;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}

/* Overview and detail chart sections */
.overview-chart, .detail-chart-section {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.4);
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  border: 1px solid rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.2);
}
```
